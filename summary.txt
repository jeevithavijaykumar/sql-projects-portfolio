Video Game Sales Analysis

Project Overview:
-------------------
This project analyzes video game sales data. The data is modeled into a relational PostgreSQL database with normalized tables representing platforms, publishers, games, and regional sales.  

The SQL script implements an end-to-end pipeline, from staging and cleaning raw data to building a normalized schema and performing  insightful analytics. Business insights include identifying top-selling games globally, sales by region, trends in critic and user ratings, genre popularity, and publisher performance.
